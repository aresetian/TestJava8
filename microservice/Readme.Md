I have created the code following the article https://dzone.com/articles/microservices-spring-boot-way.

Having into account:

This code was compiled and executed with JAVA 1.8

although `mvn exec:java` works, `mvn spring-boot:run` works as well and do not need plugins(maven-compiler-plugin and exec-maven-plugin) as `mvn exec:java`.
